              Most established manufacturers don&apos;t lose because their product
              isn&apos;t good — they lose because no one is operating the channel.
              Resellers list the SKU, race the price down, run the reviews into
              the ground, and treat your brand as a commodity. Meanwhile the
              category leader is whoever bothers to show up every day.

                Whoever lists first writes the listing. Whoever races the price
                down owns the buy-box. The brand owner is last to hear when
                things break.

                Title, bullets, A+ content, backend keywords, video, variations,
                pricing strategy — most categories you&apos;d call &ldquo;competitive&rdquo; have
                listings that wouldn&apos;t pass a 10-minute audit.
